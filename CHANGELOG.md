# Changelog

## 0.10.0 — 2026-10-01

Four pull requests (#8–#11) and this version bump. **Upgrading needs no
config, env or systemd change**: everything new is either opt-in or additive.

### Added
- **Model panel** (`[[llm.panel]]`, opt-in, #8). Several independent models
  (any mix of providers, each with its own key variable) extract every changed
  post once each; an event is published only when `panel_quorum` of them (a
  majority by default) extracted the same window. A failed model abstains and
  counts against every event, and with fewer answers than the quorum the sync
  fails rather than reporting an empty announcement. A window too few models
  saw is not published but is reported like a rejected extraction (anomaly,
  notification, `rejected_extractions` on `/healthz`). Without a panel the
  single-model extractor is unchanged (same prompt, same voting)
- **`/healthz` `extraction`** (#8): which models extract events and how many
  must agree, or the single-model consensus. `prop-firm-calendar eval` also
  scores each panel member alone, from the same calls
- **Live monitor** (#10): `scripts/check_live.py` checks an instance from
  outside the way a subscriber's app would (healthz ok, a well-formed feed
  with events, the API answering). `.github/workflows/live-monitor.yml` runs
  it against the public instance every 30 minutes and opens, updates and
  closes a `live-feed-down` issue. The server leaves the monitor's
  User-Agent out of its usage statistics
- **`schedule_note`** in source profiles (#11), shown per source on
  `/healthz` and, while the firm has nothing upcoming, on the status page.
  Blueberry Funded's explains why its calendar can be empty
- **Independent ICS conformance tests** (#9): the feed is read back with
  icalendar in five zones across every 2026 DST change, each time resolved
  through the feed's own `VTIMEZONE`

### Fixed
- **The hour repeated when clocks go back** (#9). An instant in its second
  pass was written as TZID-local time, which RFC 5545 reads as the first
  pass: a London-zone window ending 01:30 GMT on 25 Oct ended an hour early.
  Such instants are now written in UTC. The public instance (fixed GMT+3)
  was not affected
- **Topstep titles name the holiday** (#11), e.g. "⏳ Early Close —
  Thanksgiving" instead of 13 identical "⏳ Early Close" entries. Applies to
  rows extracted after Topstep next edits its article
- `tests/test_autodeploy.py` runs on git < 2.28 (the production host has
  2.25) (#9)

### Changed
- Every feed event is `TRANSP:TRANSPARENT` (#9): a firm's maintenance window
  is not the subscriber's busy time. UIDs are unchanged
- README: the pipeline diagram shows the real system, a subscriber FAQ, and a
  JSON API example taken from the public instance (#11)

## 0.9.0 — 2026-09-30

First version string since 0.8.1. It covers the two sections below it, which
were merged and deployed in August without a version bump, plus the fixes
here. **Upgrading needs no config, env or systemd change** (see "Renamed").

### Fixed
- **Every event linked to FTMO.** The feed passed `[source] url` — FTMO's
  index page — as the link for every event, so Topstep, Blueberry Funded and E8
  Markets rows all sent subscribers to ftmo.com. Each event now links to its own
  announcement (state records the post URL; older entries fall back to their
  firm's page and heal on the next sync)
- **Events beyond `max_days_ahead` were lost for good.** They were rejected,
  and an unchanged post is never re-extracted, so Topstep's 2027-01-01 closure
  never appeared even once it was in range. They are now held in state
  (`deferred`) and published once within range, with no LLM call — also for
  posts that have since left the index page. After upgrading, each tracked post
  is re-extracted **once** (state written before 0.9 cannot say what it dropped)
- **Rejected extractions were invisible.** Only a log line said an event had
  been dropped (e.g. an E8 row with no stated offset). A rejection that drops a
  real event now raises a per-firm anomaly (non-zero exit, notification, 503 on
  `/healthz` for that run), and each `/healthz` source reports
  `rejected_extractions`, `events_upcoming` and `events_deferred`
- **Auto-deploy waits for CI.** `scripts/autodeploy.sh` rebuilt production from
  `main` whatever CI said; it now deploys a commit only after the `CI` workflow
  passed for it (`scripts/ci_gate.py`, stdlib only). The first deploy of this
  version is still made by the old script; opt out with
  `AUTODEPLOY_REQUIRE_CI=0` — see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md

### Added
- **Read-only JSON API** in serve mode: `/api/v1/events?firm=&type=&from=&to=`,
  `/api/v1/next` (the current or next window per firm) and `/api/v1/` (index).
  CORS-open, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`, `ETag`/`304`. Same state
  and de-duplication as the feed
- **Evidence spans**: each event carries the announcement's own words for it,
  verified word-for-word against the scraped text (ICS/Google description, API).
  An unfound quote publishes the event as *(unconfirmed)*;
  `[events] require_evidence = true` rejects it
- **`prop-firm-calendar eval`**: the production prompt over every golden fixture
  N times against a real model, diffed against the expected events; also a
  `live_llm` pytest marker and a manual/weekly workflow that needs the
  `LLM_API_KEY` secret
- **Secret scanning**: a gitleaks CI job over each push/PR's new commits, an
  optional pre-commit config, and `SECURITY.md`

### Changed
- **One calendar entry per window across posts** (Google sync): a follow-up
  post re-announcing a window shares the existing entry, which is deleted only
  when the last post announcing it withdraws it. Duplicates created by earlier
  versions are merged on the first run after upgrading

### Renamed
- Package `ftmo_calendar` → **`prop_firm_calendar`**, distribution
  `ftmo-calendar` → **`prop-firm-calendar`**, command **`prop-firm-calendar`**
- Kept as aliases, so nothing deployed breaks: the **`ftmo-calendar`** command
  (same entry point), and **`import ftmo_calendar[.x]`**, which resolves to the
  very same module objects and emits a `DeprecationWarning`
- Deliberately *not* renamed: ICS `UID`s (`…@ftmo-calendar` — changing them
  would duplicate every subscriber's events), the Google `aftc_key` reconcile
  property, the compose service `ftmo-calendar`, the `ftmo-autodeploy` systemd
  unit, the `ftmo` container user, and the `ftmo-events.ics` default path
- PRODID is now `-//Bogzx//prop-firm-calendar//EN` and descriptions credit
  `prop-firm-calendar`; those two strings are the only bytes of the feed the
  rename moved (pinned in `tests/test_ftmo_compatibility.py`)
- Change-notification heading reads "Trading calendar updated"

## Multi-firm — merged 2026-08-17…24 (#3–#5), shipped without a version bump

It is no longer an FTMO tool. Three more prop firms ship, each verified against
its live site, and the feed can be sliced per firm.

Nothing an existing subscriber has changes. `event_key` — the identity Google
Calendar reconciliation depends on — is computed exactly as before, and the
unfiltered `/feed.ics` renders byte-identically from the same state (checked by
running the previous revision against the same fixture and diffing: the whole
ICS SHA-256 matches; pinned in `tests/test_ftmo_compatibility.py`).

### Added — more firms
- **Topstep** (`topstep`) — the full-year CME holiday table. Times are stated in
  `CT`, so the profile uses `America/Chicago`: the table straddles both US
  daylight-saving changeovers, and five of its thirteen rows fall in CDT while
  eight fall in CST. A fixed offset would have passed eight and silently broken
  five
- **Blueberry Funded** (`blueberry-funded`) — recurring crypto maintenance
  windows, stated in `BST` (`Europe/London`). The article prints each window in
  EDT as well, which the golden test uses as the firm's own second opinion on
  our arithmetic
- **E8 Markets** (`e8-markets`) — monthly holiday schedule. **This firm has no
  correct IANA zone.** Their help centre states the server moves to UTC+2 "at
  the beginning of November" and UTC+3 "at the end of March"; Europe/Athens
  reverts a week earlier and a fixed offset never moves, so any zone chosen
  would be an hour wrong for roughly a week each year. New profile flag
  `require_stated_offset` makes the pipeline use the offset the announcement
  itself prints on every row and **reject** anything that omits one, rather than
  publish it at a guessed hour
- New profile key `strip_selectors`: elements removed from the matched content
  before its text is read. Intercom help centres nest a "Related Articles" strip
  *inside* `<article>`, and those teaser headlines are exactly the confident,
  unrelated prose that becomes wrong calendar entries

### Added — per-firm feeds and health
- **`/feed.ics?firms=ftmo,topstep`**, combinable with `?types=`. `/feed.ics`
  with no parameters is untouched and still returns everything
- Feeds are named after their contents: one firm keeps that firm's name, several
  read "Prop Firm Trading Updates". An FTMO-only deployment is unchanged
- **Per-firm health.** `/healthz` gains `sources` (each firm's own freshness,
  errors, anomalies and staleness verdict) and `unhealthy_sources`; any
  unhealthy firm makes the overall `ok` false with `status: "degraded"`. A firm
  that has gone quiet is individually visible instead of averaged into an
  overall green. The `/status` page grows a matching SOURCES panel
- **Firms are isolated.** Each is fetched, extracted and reconciled
  independently, so one firm's redesign cannot freeze the others' calendars.
  Only when *every* firm fails does the run fail — which, with one firm
  configured, is exactly the previous behaviour

### Added — a status page that is natively multi-firm
- **Firm filter chips** on the landing page, wired to the `?firms=` feed filter
  that previously existed only for people willing to hand-write the URL. They
  compose with the type chips, and with every box ticked the URL stays a bare
  `/feed.ics` — the unfiltered feed is served straight from disk, so nobody is
  moved onto the re-rendering path by visiting the page
- **Firm badges in the schedule table.** With several firms merged into one
  chronological list, a row reading "Platform maintenance" did not say whose.
  The badge sits inside the event cell rather than in a fourth column, which
  would be unreadable on a phone. Posts written before per-firm tracking are
  attributed to the first configured firm rather than rendering blank
- **Branding follows the firm list.** Title, header and meta description are
  derived by the same rule as the calendar name (`ics.calendar_name`), so the
  page heading and the name in a subscriber's calendar app cannot disagree: one
  firm keeps that firm's name, several read "Prop Firm Trading Calendar". The
  FTMO-specific upstream link and affiliation notice generalise with it
- A single-firm deployment's page is visually unchanged — the only differences
  in the rendered HTML are an unused CSS rule and the rewritten filter script
- **Fixed a latent bug in that script**: it collected `.filters input` and read
  `data-type` from every match, so adding a second filter axis to the same
  container would have emitted `?types=null`. Selectors are now scoped per axis

### Added — scraping politely
- **An honest User-Agent.** The scraper identified as Chrome 120; it now says
  `TradingCalendarBot` and links the project, so an operator who wants it to
  stop can find out who it is
- **robots.txt is fetched, cached per host, and obeyed** — including rules that
  name this bot specifically. A disallowed URL raises `RobotsDisallowed` rather
  than being quietly skipped. An unreachable robots.txt fails open: someone
  else's outage is not consent withheld
- **`Crawl-delay` honoured** (capped at 30s), a process-wide per-host request
  floor, and randomised stagger between firms. All tunable under `[scrape]`

### Added — configuration
- **`[[firms]]`**: an array of firms, each naming a profile plus optional
  `url` / `timezone` / `keywords` / `max_posts` / `max_age_days` / `enabled`
  overrides. Omit it and `[source]` is used as the single firm, unchanged
- State file v4 adds `firm` to each post. Older state loads untouched, and
  unattributed posts are read as belonging to the first configured firm so
  nothing disappears from a per-firm feed on upgrade. `firm` is deliberately
  **not** part of `event_key`

## Self-hosting fixes — merged 2026-08-17 (#2), shipped without a version bump

Self-hosting works again, silent failures became loud ones, and a prop firm is
now a TOML file.

### Fixed
- **`docker compose up -d` publishes the feed the README documents.** The
  shipped compose file bound `127.0.0.1:8133` — one maintainer's reverse-proxy
  arrangement, published as everyone's default — while the README told people to
  subscribe on `:8080`. It now publishes `${PORT:-8080}:8080`; the loopback and
  Caddy specifics moved to `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, whose own instructions were
  stale in the opposite direction (bind `:8080`, proxy `:8080`, against a
  container listening on `:8133`)
- **Default timezone no longer drifts an hour for five months a year.** FTMO
  states every announcement in MetaTrader platform time — a *fixed* GMT+3.
  `Europe/Bucharest` equals that only from late March to late October, so any
  announcement omitting its offset was parsed an hour early all winter. Both
  `[source] timezone` and `[calendar] timezone` now default to `Etc/GMT-3`
- Scraper no longer falls back to `article, div.entry-content`. On a real FTMO
  post page that matches the first related-posts teaser card, so losing
  `div.content.tu` would have fed the model a list of headlines and produced
  confident, wrong calendar entries. Selectors are class-anchored per source and
  structural drift raises `ScrapeError`
- Stats are no longer serialized and fsync-replaced on every HTTP request —
  writes are debounced, which closes a request-loop amplification vector on the
  public feed
- `?types=` feeds are cached per type-set (invalidated by the state file), so a
  filtered subscriber no longer re-runs the VTIMEZONE bisection on every poll

### Added — failure detection
- **`/healthz` returns 503 when the feed is not trustworthy**: the last sync
  raised, no successful sync landed within twice the sync interval, or a run
  reported an anomaly. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` has always told operators to point
  UptimeRobot at this endpoint, which until now returned 200 unconditionally.
  New fields: `status`, `last_success`, `last_success_age_seconds`, `stale`,
  `stale_after_seconds`, `anomalies`
- **Anomalies**: a run that completes without raising but whose result is not
  believable. Two are detected — the keyword gate matching none of N scraped
  posts (the wording or the page moved), and a post that previously extracted
  events losing some with none new to replace them. They exit non-zero, notify,
  turn `/healthz` 503, and show on the status page
- **Refuses to delete on doubt.** A post whose extraction loses events with
  nothing new to replace them — collapsing to zero, or shrinking from 8 events
  to 1 — no longer deletes the missing future events; they are kept and
  flagged. A degraded extraction is indistinguishable from a withdrawn
  announcement and far more likely; a genuine reschedule announces new times
  and reconciles normally. `[events] delete_on_empty_extraction = true`
  restores the old behaviour
- Status page shows the age of the last *successful* sync and the source name;
  the badge distinguishes OPERATIONAL / SYNC ERROR / SYNC STALE / NEEDS REVIEW
- Serve mode refuses to start on an unwritable data directory instead of running
  healthy while every write vanishes (the uid-1000 bind-mount trap)

### Added — correctness
- `confidence` is finally read. It was declared, prompted for and consensus-voted
  since 0.5, then discarded: a guess reached subscribers looking exactly as
  certain as a stated maintenance window. Low-confidence events are now marked in
  their title and description, or dropped entirely with
  `[events] reject_low_confidence = true`. It is deliberately excluded from
  `event_key`, so a confidence flicker cannot orphan a calendar entry

### Added — features
- **Config-driven source adapter.** A prop firm is a TOML profile
  (`src/ftmo_calendar/sources/profiles/`) plus a recorded fixture, selected with
  `[source] profile`. The profile carries the URL, selectors, link pattern,
  timezone, keyword gate and firm-specific prompt hints; `example-firm.toml`
  documents every field. The FTMO scraper is now one of these
- **Generic webhook notifier** (`WEBHOOK_URL`): a JSON POST on every new
  interruption, alongside Discord and Telegram. Carries both rendered `text`
  (Slack/Mattermost work as-is) and structured `created` / `removed` /
  `anomalies`. An ICS feed is pull-based and quiet; this is the push

### Added — supply chain and tests
- Docker image installs with `-c requirements.lock`, pinning every resolved
  version. The production server rebuilds from `main` every five minutes, so it
  had been picking up whatever each dependency released that day
- `ruff` and `mypy` pinned to the locked versions in the `dev` extra — an
  unpinned `ruff` turns a contributor's green build red on someone else's
  release schedule (`ruff` 0.16 did exactly this by starting to format code
  blocks inside Markdown)
- CI builds the Docker image and smoke-tests serve mode. A broken Dockerfile
  used to reach the auto-deploying production server before it reached a human
- **Real recorded fixtures.** The previous 22- and 9-line fixtures were
  hand-authored to match the parser, while CONTRIBUTING called them "recorded".
  `scripts/record_fixtures.py` captures live pages; `tests/fixtures/ftmo/` now
  holds three real ones
- **Golden test** pinning the Memorial Day announcement of 21 May 2026 — the
  extraction 0.8.0 verified by hand and recorded nowhere — to its 8 typed events,
  their announced wall-clock times, their type distribution and their stability
  under consensus voting
- Tests pin the shipped files against the code: `config.example.toml` cannot
  drift from the event taxonomy again, and compose/README/DEPLOYMENT must agree
  on a port

### Changed
- `config.example.toml` regenerated from `DEFAULT_SUMMARIES` — it documented the
  pre-0.8 taxonomy, listing `holiday_hours` and omitting four of the seven
  current event types
- `[notify] on_anomalies` (default true) controls the new alerts

## 0.8.1 — 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- ICS feed times no longer render as UTC `Z` timestamps. Events are now
  written as local times in the calendar's timezone (`[calendar] timezone`,
  default `Europe/Bucharest` — FTMO platform time) with a `TZID` reference and
  a generated `VTIMEZONE` block carrying the real DST rules, plus an
  `X-WR-TIMEZONE` calendar header. Timezone-aware clients show the identical
  instant they always did (converted to each viewer's local time), but clients
  that mishandle the `Z` suffix — which made a 9:00 GMT+3 maintenance window
  appear at 6:00 — now read FTMO's announced wall-clock times directly. The
  raw feed also matches the announcements again instead of being shifted
  three hours for everyone east of Greenwich.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-06-10

Granular event taxonomy (grounded in FTMO's announcement history) + stats.

### Added
- Seven event types replacing the coarse four: `maintenance`, `crypto_closure`,
  `holiday_closure`, `early_close`, `late_open`, `symbol_event`, `other`
  (`holiday_hours` remains valid for pre-0.8 state files). Derived from a
  sample of historical FTMO posts; verified live: the Memorial Day announcement
  extracts as 8 correctly-typed events with zero rejections
- Event titles now carry the affected symbols/platforms ("⏳ Early Close —
  US30.cash, US100.cash"), extracted via a new `affected` field; consensus
  voting merges partial symbol lists, keeping the most complete
- Prompt now explicitly ignores leverage adjustments, execution-model news,
  and permanent session-time changes
- Landing page: seven filter chips
- Self-hosted anonymous statistics in serve mode: page views, unique visitors
  (random-id first-party cookie), feed pulls, unique feed clients; footer
  summary, `GET /stats` JSON with 30-day history, persisted to `stats.json`

## 0.7.0 — 2026-06-10

Per-interest feeds: subscribe to only what you trade.

### Added
- Type-filtered feeds in serve mode: `/feed.ics?types=crypto_closure` (any
  comma-separated combination of `maintenance`, `crypto_closure`,
  `holiday_hours`, `other`); each URL acts as its own calendar; unknown types
  return a 400 listing valid ones; filtered calendars are named after their
  filter
- Landing page filter chips: untick event types and the subscribe URL (and
  webcal link) rebuild live
- Tracked events store their event type (state v3; older state files load
  transparently — pre-v3 events appear only in the unfiltered feed until they
  regenerate)

## 0.6.0 — 2026-06-09

A real landing page for hosted deployments.

### Added
- The served `/` and `/status` page is now a designed, self-contained landing
  page (trading-terminal aesthetic, no external requests): live countdown to
  the next interruption, all times rendered in the visitor's local timezone,
  one-click feed URL copy + `webcal://` open, per-app subscribe instructions,
  upcoming/in-progress/past schedule, sync health footer
- Works without JavaScript (UTC times as fallback); responsive down to phones

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-09

Deterministic extraction, verified live on DeepSeek via OpenRouter.

### Added
- **Consensus voting** (`[llm] consensus_runs`, default 3): each changed post is
  extracted N times and only majority events are kept — stable results even on
  hosted APIs that aren't deterministic at temperature 0 (OpenRouter routes one
  model id across several providers). Verified live: 4 consecutive consensus
  extractions of a real FTMO post produced identical event sets.
- Prompt rule excluding Client Area/IT/account-services maintenance (the one
  borderline case that flickered between runs) — only trading interruptions count
- `seed` hint on OpenAI-compatible calls for providers that honor it
- Consensus identity merges timezone-attribution variants of the same event,
  preferring the explicit offset

## 0.4.0 — 2026-06-09

Feed-first hosting: run a public feed for a whole group with just an LLM key.

### Added
- **Feed-only mode** (`[calendar] enabled = false`): no Google account needed
  anywhere — the host runs one container, subscribers paste a URL
- `--dry-run` no longer requires Google credentials (preview before any setup)
- Status page upgraded into a shareable landing page: next upcoming event,
  sync health, and per-app subscribe instructions
- `/healthz` now reports `next_run` so monitors can detect overdue syncs
- ICS feed: `REFRESH-INTERVAL`/`X-PUBLISHED-TTL` hints and per-event source
  links in descriptions
- Docker `HEALTHCHECK` against `/healthz`

### Fixed
- Config and state files written by Notepad/PowerShell (UTF-8 BOM) parse
  correctly instead of failing with a cryptic TOML error
- Serve mode writes the feed from existing state at startup — a restart with a
  failing sync no longer 404s the feed
- A persistent identical sync error notifies once, not every interval

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-09

Reach & visibility: notifications, ICS feed, hosted mode, Docker.

### Added
- Discord webhook and Telegram bot notifications: new/removed events, run
  failures, and an optional periodic heartbeat (`[notify] heartbeat_hours`)
- ICS feed export (`[ics] enabled`): subscribe from any calendar app with
  zero OAuth setup
- `ftmo-calendar serve`: periodic sync loop + HTTP server exposing
  `/feed.ics`, a `/status` page, and `/healthz` — host one feed for a whole
  trading group; a failing sync never takes the feed down
- Docker support: `docker compose up -d` runs serve mode with all runtime
  files in a `./data` volume
- State v2: tracked events carry display data; heartbeat timestamp persisted
  (v1 state files load transparently)

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-09

Complete rewrite as a professional package.

### Added
- `ftmo-calendar` CLI: `run` (with `--dry-run`), `auth` (with `--check`), `status`
- Provider-agnostic LLM parsing: Gemini or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Groq, Ollama, …) via `[llm]` config
- Service-account auth mode: no browser, no token expiry — ideal for servers
- Reconcile sync: rescheduled/withdrawn announcements update or remove their
  calendar events instead of leaving stale duplicates
- Multi-post scraping matching FTMO's redesigned site (the old `trup-primary`
  selector no longer exists)
- Content-hash caching: unchanged posts cost zero LLM calls
- Event reminders, type-specific summaries, trimmed descriptions
- Validation: duration caps, date windows, timezone normalization from the
  announcement's stated offset
- Tests, ruff, mypy, GitHub Actions CI, TOML config

### Fixed
- Expired OAuth tokens no longer launch a browser flow inside cron (which hung
  forever on headless machines); `run` now fails loudly with instructions
- Documented the 7-day token death: OAuth apps in "Testing" status must be
  published to Production

### Removed
- `main.py` single-file script, `run.sh`, dev scrap scripts, committed `app.log`
