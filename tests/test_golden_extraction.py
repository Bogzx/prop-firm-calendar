"""Golden test: one real announcement, pinned end-to-end to its calendar events.

CHANGELOG 0.8.0 records that the Memorial Day / Buddha's Birthday post of
21 May 2026 "extracts as 8 correctly-typed events with zero rejections". That
was checked by hand against a live model and then written down nowhere, so
every later prompt tweak, taxonomy change or validation edit risked regressing
it silently.

This pins the whole deterministic path:

    recorded HTML  ->  scraped announcement text   (sources/web.py)
    pinned RawEvents  ->  8 TradingEvents          (parsing/validate.py)
    3 identical runs  ->  the same 8 events        (parsing/llm.py consensus)

What it deliberately does not do is call a model: CI has no API key, and a test
that needs one is a test that gets skipped. The model's half of the contract is
pinned as data instead — trading-update-21-may-2026.expected.json is what a
correct extraction of this text looks like, reviewable in a diff. If the prompt
changes such that a model would no longer produce it, that JSON has to change
too, and the change is visible.
