"""Golden test: E8 Markets' real monthly schedule, and its refusal to guess an hour.

E8 is the firm that has no correct timezone. Their own help centre says the
server moves to UTC+2 "at the beginning of November" and UTC+3 "at the end of
March" — a window that matches no IANA zone, since Europe/Athens reverts a week
earlier and a fixed Etc/GMT-3 never moves at all. Whatever zone were chosen for
them would be an hour wrong for about a week each year.

What makes them shippable anyway is that every row of their schedule carries
its own "(gmt+3)". So the profile sets require_stated_offset: the announcement's
own offset is used, and a row that omits one is rejected instead of published.
The last test here is the one that matters — it is the proof that the fallback
really is off.
