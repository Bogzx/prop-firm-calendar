"""Existing FTMO subscribers must not notice that this became multi-firm.

There are real people subscribed to the public feed right now, and two ways to
hurt them. One is the calendar reconcile: `event_key` is the identity Google
Calendar entries are matched on, so if the way it is computed moves at all,
every event already in someone's calendar is orphaned and silently recreated —
duplicated for anyone who kept the old one, and stripped of any reminder they
had personally set. The other is the feed itself: the same state must keep
producing the same ICS bytes, or apps re-sync every event as new.

The hashes below were captured by running the *base branch* (audit/fixes-and-
features, the commit this work started from) against the same fixture, then
diffed against this branch: identical, including the whole-file SHA-256. They
are pinned here as literals so that a future change which alters them has to
change this file too, in a diff a reviewer will see.
