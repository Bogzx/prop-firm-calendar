"""Golden test: Topstep's real holiday table, pinned end-to-end to its events.

Same discipline as test_golden_extraction.py does for FTMO — recorded HTML in,
calendar events out, with the model's half pinned as reviewable data rather
than called live. What it adds is the reason Topstep is worth shipping at all:
its announcement spans a whole year in a daylight-saving zone, so it is the one
source where getting the timezone wrong is *visible* rather than seasonal. Five
of the thirteen rows fall in CDT and eight in CST; a fixed offset passes eight
of them and quietly breaks five.
