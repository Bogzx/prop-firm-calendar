"""Rate limiting, robots.txt compliance and request staggering.

One firm on a six-hour interval is a rounding error in anybody's access log.
A dozen firms, all fetched back-to-back the instant the sync loop wakes, is a
small burst against a dozen unrelated hosts at exactly the same second of every
interval — and every one of those hosts is a company that could simply block
the project instead of complaining.

So: identify honestly in the User-Agent, ask robots.txt first and believe the
answer, keep a floor on how often the same host is touched, and jitter the
start of each firm's fetch so the schedule is not a synchronised thundering
herd.

`RobotsPolicy.allows()` fails *open* on a robots.txt that cannot be fetched —
a 500 or a timeout on a robots file is not consent withheld, it is no answer,
and treating every network blip as a prohibition would silently empty the
calendar. A robots.txt that loads and says no is obeyed absolutely.
