"""Declarative source profiles: a prop firm is a TOML file, not a Python module.

A profile says where the announcement lives on a page and how to recognise it.
Everything else — fetching, retrying, date parsing, post identity, the LLM
extraction, validation and reconcile — is already firm-agnostic, so adding
FundedNext or The5ers means writing one of these plus a recorded fixture.

Profiles ship in `sources/profiles/*.toml`; `[source] profile = "name"` selects
one, or the value may be a path to a TOML file outside the package.

Selectors are deliberately *required* and deliberately narrow. An earlier
version fell back to `soup.select_one("article, div.entry-content")`, which on
the real FTMO post page matches an `article.post-card` teaser from the
related-posts strip — the scraper would have handed a list of headlines to the
LLM, which would have dutifully extracted plausible, wrong calendar entries.
Structural drift must raise, not guess: see `min_content_chars` and
`WebSource.parse_post`.

    #: firms nest a "related articles" strip *inside* the article element, so

    #: entries. Removing them is precise; widening the content selector is not.

    #: For firms whose platform clock follows no IANA zone. E8 Markets is the
    #: worked example: their MT5 server runs UTC+3 from the end of March to the
    #: beginning of November and UTC+2 otherwise, which is neither Europe/Athens
    #: (reverts a week earlier) nor a fixed offset. Any zone chosen for them is
    #: wrong for about a week a year. Since every row of their announcement
    #: carries its own "(gmt+3)", the correct answer is to use what the firm
