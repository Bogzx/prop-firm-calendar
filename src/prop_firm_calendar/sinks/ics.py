"""ICS (RFC 5545) feed generation.

The feed is a projection of the state file — regenerated wholesale after each
run. Anyone can subscribe to the resulting file/URL from Google, Apple, or
Outlook calendars without OAuth.

Event times are written as local times in the calendar's timezone with a TZID
reference and a matching VTIMEZONE block — the same representation calendar
apps use in their own exports. Clients still convert to each viewer's
timezone, but the raw feed reads in the calendar's timezone (matching FTMO's
announced times) instead of UTC, which read "shifted" to anyone east of
Greenwich and broke on naive parsers that drop the Z suffix.
