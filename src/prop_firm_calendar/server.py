"""Hosted mode: periodic sync loop + HTTP server exposing the ICS feed.

One person runs `prop-firm-calendar serve` (or the Docker container); any trader
subscribes to `http://host:port/feed.ics` from Google/Apple/Outlook calendar —
no OAuth, no API keys on the subscriber side.

Endpoints: GET /feed.ics (the calendar), GET /status (HTML), GET /healthz (JSON),
and the read-only JSON API under /api/v1/ (see api.py).

`/healthz` is the contract monitors are pointed at (docs/DEPLOYMENT.md), so it
answers "is this feed trustworthy right now?", not merely "is the process up":
it returns 503 when the last sync errored, when no successful sync has landed
within twice the configured interval, or when the last run reported an anomaly
(see pipeline.RunReport.anomalies).
