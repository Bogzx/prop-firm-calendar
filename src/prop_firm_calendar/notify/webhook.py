"""Generic JSON webhook — one POST to whatever URL you own.

An ICS feed is pull-based and quiet: a subscriber learns about a maintenance
window whenever their calendar app next polls, which can be hours. This pushes
the moment a new interruption is detected, to anything that accepts a JSON
POST — Slack and Mattermost incoming webhooks, n8n/Zapier, or your own service.

The payload carries both a rendered `text` (so Slack-shaped receivers work with
no configuration at all) and structured `events`, so a receiver that wants the
individual windows does not have to parse prose.
