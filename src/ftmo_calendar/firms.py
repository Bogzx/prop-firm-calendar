"""Run every configured firm in one sync, isolating each firm's failures.

The single most important property here: **one firm's bad day must not cost
another firm's subscribers their calendar.** Before multi-firm support a scrape
failure aborted the run, which was correct when there was one source. With ten,
an unreachable site or a redesigned page would otherwise stop the other nine
from ever updating — the exact silent-staleness failure this project exists to
prevent, arrived at from the opposite direction.

So each firm is fetched, extracted and reconciled independently; a firm that
raises is recorded as unhealthy and the run continues. Only when *every* firm
fails does the run itself fail, which is what keeps the legacy single-firm
behaviour (raise, alert, exit non-zero) exactly as it was.
